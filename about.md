## The Need

Many would agree, that our nation has been moving the wrong direction for years and is now in trouble; morally, financially, spiritually and socially.  Wonderful ministries are calling their constituents to fasting and prayer unlike America has not experienced in modern times. Here is the question for all Americans:  Do you want for your family and grandchildren to lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity? The Bible promises that we will experience a calm and quite life if we pray for our leaders. We believe that God has given his people another chance to see our nation blessed. Will you join what we believe will be millions in taking up this prayer with promise?	

## The Congressional Task Force

A group of US Congressional and Senatorial leaders is challenging every citizen to pray for each Congressman in the 435 Congressional Districts. They are planning to authorize and award leaders within each Congressional District for a Congressional Service medals for exemplary performance and service. We anticipate serving our elected leaders by approaching them as servants asking, “How can we help you?”
